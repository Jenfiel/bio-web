        <h1>AUTOBIOGRAPHY<br>WEBSITE</h1>
        <p>Hello there, I am Jeslee R. Tomarong and this is my Autobiography Website.<br>
        I’ve created this website based on my prior knowledge, modules and of course YT tutorials <br>
        As you can see I am not really good in making a website, you can see the color, fonts, spacing <br>
        that you can say something is off so apologies, I just use black and yellow because its my favorite. <br>
        This website is about me, of course and even though the information here in my Autobiography <br>
        is limited, I have my contacts below if you want to know me well. <br>
        I hope you enjoy your time reading my Website!</p>

            <div class="p2p"> I am <strong>Jeslee R. Tomarong</strong>, I am 18 yrs old. I lived in Suba-Masulog Basak Lapu-Lapu City. We are 6 in our family. I am the second youngest member of our family. We used to live in Mandaue City but we migrated here in Lapu-Lapu City because it's convenient for us due to my mother's job. 
            This photo on the left corner is my profile picture in facebook it's been 3 years that photo taken, we are going to my mom's province that time, Badian Cebu a beautiful place that has lots of beaches and destinations to trip, the famous one is the kawasan falls. We used to go to beach every time we goes to badian, its really fun, and I tell you a secret when I was 15, if I'm not mistaken I nearly get drown because I don't know how to swim and yes I didnt know that its really deep when I jump so I've panic but thankfully my cousins are there and they save me, but now I know how to swim and I want to go to beaches or swimming pools on vacations. </div>
